Non-Volatile Memory Library

This is src/test/pmem_deep_flush/README.

This directory contains a test for pmem_deep_flush().

The program in pmem_deep_flush.c takes a file as an argument, memory
maps that file, and prints out the return value from pmem_deep_flush()
on the resulting range, and ranges that overlap with it.
